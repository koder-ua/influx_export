* add lzma/tar+gzip compression/decompression func
* collect cluster data first. Add .sh to collect data or .salt
* build cluster model from collected data:
    * devices info in form:
        node_name -> dev_name -> dev_tags and vals, like

        ceph001:
            sdc: {__tags__: [osd_data], osd_id: 12, size: "5T"}
* sync config set device types to be selected (how to match it with influx series tagging inconsistency?)
* model + sync.cfg + influx_sync -> series_data.bin + config + model -> series_data.lzma (with embedded config and model)
* series_data.lzma + reporter.py -> report + ....
